Lake Tahoe project website

Lake Tahoe is a single page practice project website that showcases all that Lake Tahoe has to offer from hotel and lodging accommodations, to ski resorts, and diversity in wildlife.

The webpage is mainly structured as center aligned to keep a consistent, responsive, mobile-first approach layout, while maintaining a simple look and feel.

The design elements of the webpage were provided in an online web development course. Other than developing the website through HTML and CSS, I incorporated my own taste on the color scheme, and external links to apply more towards a real-life application.
